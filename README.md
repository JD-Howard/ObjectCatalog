# ObjectCatalog
Special .NetStandard collection that is useful when you have a lot of data correlation to perform. It essentially wraps a collection of objects, you can preload property indices or let them occur dynamically. After the index has been created, subsequent lookups on the same property/sub-property path will be much faster.
